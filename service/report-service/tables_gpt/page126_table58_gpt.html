I'm unable to generate the exact HTML table with merged cells based on the image you uploaded, as it does not contain visible table elements or data. However, I can guide you on how to construct an HTML table with `rowspan` and `colspan` based on typical scenarios. You can apply the guidance to your case once you have the actual data:

### Example HTML Table with Merged Cells

```html
<h3>중소기업을 위한 지속가능경영보고서 매뉴얼</h3>

<table border="1">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th colspan="2">Header 1</th>
      <th rowspan="2">Header 2</th>
      <th colspan="2">Header 3</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Subheader 1</th>
      <th>Subheader 2</th>
      <th>Subheader 3</th>
      <th>Subheader 4</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td rowspan="2">Rowspan 2</td>
      <td>Data 1</td>
      <td>Data 2</td>
      <td colspan="2">Data 3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Data 4</td>
      <td>Data 5</td>
      <td>Data 6</td>
      <td>Data 7</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```

### Explanation

- **`colspan`**: Merges cells horizontally. For example, `<th colspan="2">Header 1</th>` merges two cells into one.
- **`rowspan`**: Merges cells vertically. For example, `<td rowspan="2">Rowspan 2</td>` merges two rows into one.

Ensure to adjust the structure based on the actual names and data from your PDF.
