I'm unable to directly extract text from the image, but I can guide you on how to incorporate the heading and conceptualize the table structure.

Based on the image layout, here's a HTML structure you might use:

```html
<h3>사례 GV00-1: 지배구조 접근전략</h3>

<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: center;">
      <th>주주</th>
      <th>헌텔사리</th>
      <th>기대효과</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td rowspan="3">회사의 역할</td>
      <td>투자자</td>
      <td>성과 향상</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>임직원</td>
      <td>자질 향상</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>협력업체</td>
      <td>파트너십 강화</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```

### Notes:
- This is a hypothetical table structure meant to incorporate potential colspan/rowspan usage.
- Adjust the content based on the text in the image and logical structuring observed.

You would need to replace placeholder text with the actual text content from the PDF or image. Adjust rowspan and colspan attributes depending on how those sections are merged in the actual document.
