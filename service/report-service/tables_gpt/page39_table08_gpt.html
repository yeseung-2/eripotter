I'm unable to directly extract text or structured data from images, but I can help create a sample HTML table for the content based on your description of the table and the image you've provided. 

Here's a sample of what the HTML might look like, assuming the table relates to the "주요 사업" section mentioned in the image:

```html
<h3>주요 사업</h3>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>카테고리별 매출 비중</th>
      <th></th>
      <th>국가별 매출 비중</th>
      <th></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td rowspan="4">서울본부 (생활/대기업)</td>
      <td>34%</td>
      <td rowspan="4">연구</td>
      <td>25%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>28%</td>
      <td>36%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>17%</td>
      <td>-</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>10%</td>
      <td>-</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>기타</td>
      <td>11%</td>
      <td>한국 외 기타 시장</td>
      <td>26%</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```

Please adjust the content inside the table cells according to the data you need. The layout is based on a simple assumption of how the table might be structured given the headers and descriptions. If there are specific changes or additional details, let me know!
